# Explanation for 01.BestTimeToBuy&SellStock

Imagine you're an investor who wants to maximize profit from buying and eventually selling a single stock. Your task is to decide which day to buy and which day to sell based on a sequence of stock prices given over a series of days. The key is to buy low and sell high, but these transactions must follow this chronological order, buying first then selling later.

To explore this intuitively, consider a sample scenario where the stock prices over several days are, for example, 7, 1, 5, 3, 6, and 4. Here, each number represents the price on a particular day. Your objective is to find the two days where you would buy and sell the stock to achieve the highest possible profit. An obvious way to think about this is by comparing each possible pair of purchase and sale days, but this approach quickly becomes impractical with larger sets of prices due to its inefficiency.

Instead, let's build intuition with a lighter touch. You start by keeping track of the lowest price encountered so far as you go through the list day by day. You update this lowest price whenever you find a cheaper price on a new day. Simultaneously, for each day's price, you calculate the potential profit if you were to sell at that day's price, using the lowest price observed to date as your buying price. This ongoing comparison helps us track the maximum potential profit throughout.

For the earlier set of prices, you initially observe a price of 7, which becomes your lowest point. When you see 1 on the next day, you recognize it as a new minimum price. Several days later, you encounter 6, offering a significant profit potential over buying at 1. You then continue this process through the remaining days, always calculating the profit potential for each day relative to the lowest price found previously and simultaneously updating the record of maximum profit.

By only sweeping through the prices once while maintaining record of the smallest price and maximum profit, you arrive at an elegant and optimal solution. This efficient approach allows us to determine the highest possible gain with minimal computational load, abiding by our constraints. If by the end of this evaluation no positive profit is obtainable, the return value of zero subtly indicates that the stock trends do not favor a profitable exchange. This smart maneuver not only simplifies but also optimizes the problem-solving process, delivering results in a direct and time-efficient manner.
