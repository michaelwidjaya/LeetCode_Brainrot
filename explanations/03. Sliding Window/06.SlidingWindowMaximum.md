# Explanation for 06.SlidingWindowMaximum

Imagine you have a long line of numbers, and you're given a window of a certain size that slides from one end of this line to the other. As the window moves one step at a time, you're tasked with identifying the largest number within the window at each step. This might sound straightforward, but things get interesting when you want to do this efficiently, especially when the number line, or array, is quite large.

Let's break this down further with an example. Consider an array of numbers such as [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7] and a window of size 3. When the window starts at the very beginning of the array, it covers [1, 3, -1], with the maximum value being 3. When you slide the window right by one position, it now covers [3, -1, -3], and again, the maximum is 3. As you continue to slide the window across the array, your task is always to determine the maximum of the numbers visible within that window's current position.

At first glance, you might consider a straightforward approach where, for each new position of the window, you simply scan all the numbers within it to find the maximum. However, this method would result in quite a bit of redundant work since overlapping windows share most of their elements. This naive method would involve a lot of recalculating and quickly become inefficient, especially with larger arrays.

To optimize this, we can use a data structure known as a deque, which functions somewhat like a double-ended queue. The magic of the deque in this context is its ability to store indices of the elements in a way that keeps track of the maximum in constant time. The deque is maintained such that it holds indices in decreasing order of their corresponding values. This allows the maximum elementâ€™s index to always be at the front of the deque, ensuring quick access.

As you iterate through the array, you update the deque by removing elements that fall outside the sliding window's bounds. Simultaneously, for each element encountered, you make sure the deque only holds potential candidates for the maximum by removing indices that point to smaller numbers than the current element, as they are no longer likely to contribute to future maximums. This strategic culling ensures that the deque remains relevant and efficient.

Once you've processed each window of size k, the index at the front of the deque corresponds to the maximum element for that window. By consistently outputting the value at this index as the deque updates, you efficiently build a list of maximums for each window position without recalculating maximums from scratch.

In essence, leveraging the deque provides a streamlined technique that reduces the problem complexity significantly, shifting from what could be an inefficient nested loop approach to an operation that processes each element in linear time. This efficiency arises from only revisiting each element a fixed number of times relative to the window size, making it well-suited for large-scale data, such as in the tens of thousands that we might usually encounter in practical scenarios.
