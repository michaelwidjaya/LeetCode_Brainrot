# Explanation for 03.NetworkDelayTime

Imagine you have a network consisting of several nodes, like a web of connected routers, where each node is labeled from 1 through n. You're given a list of one-way roads with specified travel times between pairs of nodes. For each pair, the road takes a certain amount of time for a signal to travel from one node to the other. Now, suppose you start a signal from a specific node, and you want to determine how long it will take for this signal to reach every other node in the network, if that's even possible. If there's any node that the signal cannot reach, you'll need to return a special indicator, such as -1.

To make this more tangible, let's consider an example. Imagine you have four nodes, and the list of times gives you information about directed paths like a road existing from node 2 to node 1 that takes 1 unit of time, or from node 2 to node 3 that also takes 1 unit of time, and similarly, node 3 to node 4 takes another 1 unit of time. If you start your signal from node 2, you want to figure out how quickly the signal can reach all nodes. Your task is to compute the maximum time among all reachable paths using optimal travel times.

Now, let's think about how one might approach solving this problem. At a high level, the problem is about finding the shortest path in terms of time from the start node to every other node in the graph, which is a classic problem in computer science.

A naive strategy might involve exploring all possible paths from the starting node to every other node, measuring the time, and then comparing these paths. However, this approach can quickly become inefficient, especially as the network grows in size, because the number of possible paths increases dramatically.

Instead, we turn to more efficient graph traversal techniques that are specifically designed for finding shortest paths. Two common algorithms come to mind: Dijkstra's algorithm and the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Both of these algorithms can handle directed graphs with non-negative weights, which is exactly what we have here.

Dijkstra's algorithm is particularly well-suited for this task because it efficiently finds the shortest path from a single starting node to all other nodes. The key idea is to maintain a set of nodes for which the minimum time to reach them is known and iteratively expanding this set by examining the shortest path to the adjacent nodes. This is achieved using a priority queue, which helps in efficiently picking the next node with the smallest known time.

However, since we need to ensure we're considering all possible paths and no negative cycles exist (given the problem constraints), either Dijkstra's algorithm or a modified breadth-first search could be adapted here.

The main goal while using these algorithms is to keep track of two things for each node: the currently known minimum time to reach that node from the start, and whether it still needs to be updated. If, by the end of the traversal, any node's time hasn't been updated from its initial state (indicating it never got reached), it means some nodes are unreachable from the starting node, and hence the output should be -1 as specified.

Once all nodes are reachable and the minimum times are calculated, the final step is to find the maximum time from these calculated minimum times to ensure the signal has indeed reached all nodes. This maximum represents the total time it takes for the signal emanated from the starting node to permeate the entire network.

In summary, approaching this problem effectively requires transforming it from just a story about nodes and signals into a graph problem where efficient traversal techniques unveil the minimum possible delay, ensuring the solution is both optimal and performant.
