# Explanation for 06.CheapestFlightsWithinKStops

Let's dive into the problem of finding the cheapest flight route while adhering to a set limit on the number of stops you can make. Imagine you have a network of cities connected by direct flights. Each flight has an associated cost, which is essentially the price of that ticket. Your task is to start at a specified city and make your way to a destination city, but staying within the confines of making no more than a certain number of stops on the way. The challenge lies in finding the cheapest possible route under these constraints.

To better understand how to tackle this, let's think of the cities as nodes in a graph, and the flights as directed edges between these nodes, each with a weight corresponding to the flight's cost. The problem essentially becomes one of pathfinding in a weighted graph, with a unique twist of limiting the path's length in terms of hops or stops.

A straightforward approach might involve exploring all possible paths between the source and destination, keeping track of the path cost and the number of stops. However, given the potentially large size of the network, this brute-force method quickly becomes impractical due to its exponential nature. Instead, more intelligent strategies are necessary to efficiently home in on the optimal path.

This is where algorithms designed for shortest path problems in graphs become immensely useful, specifically, a variation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Bellman-Ford traditionally helps compute shortest paths from a single source to all other nodes, considering paths that may circumvent negative weight cycles. While our scenario doesn't include negative weights, the necessity to track paths with a limited number of stops requires a tweak to the algorithm.

The devised method begins by initializing the known minimum costs to reach each city starting from the source as infinite, except for the source itself, which has a zero cost. Our goal is to iteratively relax the edges in a controlled manner. Relaxation is an operation where we compare the known minimum cost to a city with the cost of reaching that city via another adjacent city plus the cost of travelling between them. If this new path offers a cheaper way to get to a city, we update our cost estimate.

To incorporate the stop limitation, the relaxation process is iterated exactly `k+1` times, which corresponds to potentially having up to `k` intermediate stops. Each iteration allows for the consideration of paths with increasing lengths, simulating the effect of taking more stops.

The core intuition here is that each relaxation pass expands the scope of considered routes by one more stop, effectively building a comprehensive cost map that adheres to the constraint of permissible stops. By the end of the `k+1` iterations, if the destination city's cost is still marked as infinite, it indicates that no valid route exists under the constraints. Otherwise, the stored cost represents the cheapest discovered route.

This approach ensures that the problem is solved in a practical manner, balancing the need for optimal pathfinding with computational efficiency. The elegance of using a modified Bellman-Ford is in its ability to account for varied path lengths dynamically, aligning perfectly with the requirements and constraints of the problem.
