# Explanation for 03.TwoSum

Imagine you're faced with the task of finding a pair of numbers in an array that, when added together, equal a specific target number. Each number in the array has a unique index, and you're looking for the indices of this pair rather than the numbers themselves. For example, if you have an array like [2, 7, 11, 15] and the target is 9, you need to determine which two numbers sum to 9. In this case, those numbers are 2 and 7, which are located at the indices 0 and 1. This kind of problem is often called the "Two Sum" problem.

Now, let's think about how you might approach solving this. Initially, you might consider the brute-force method, which involves checking every possible pair of numbers in the array to see if they add up to the target. You would start with the first number and pair it with every subsequent number to check for the target sum. Then, you move to the second number and repeat this process until you've checked all possible pairs. Although straightforward, this method can become quite inefficient, especially as the array grows larger, because it requires examining each pair separately, leading to a time complexity of O(n squared).

To improve efficiency, you could employ a more strategic approach using a hash table. A hash table can help you keep track of numbers you've already checked and their corresponding indices, allowing you to determine if the current number can be paired with any previously seen number to achieve the target sum. Here's how that works: as you iterate through the array, you calculate the complement of each number, which is the difference between the target and the current number. You then check your hash table to see if this complement is already a key in it. If it is, that means you've found the pair you are looking for â€” the current number and the complement together form the target sum, and they appear at the indices stored in the hash table and the current index you're at.

This approach gives us a significant advantage. Instead of examining every possible pair, we efficiently make use of previously gathered information; thus, reducing our time complexity to O(n), which is much more manageable for large arrays.

To sum it up, the essence of the Two Sum problem is finding two numbers that sum to a particular target by using efficient data structures such as a hash table to store and quickly query necessary information during your search. By transforming our approach from a naive brute force to a more nuanced and efficient method, we solve the problem in linear time, which is a critical advancement in scenarios involving large datasets.
