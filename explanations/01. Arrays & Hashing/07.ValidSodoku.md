# Explanation for 07.ValidSodoku

Let's dive into the concept of validating a Sudoku board. Imagine you're looking at a 9 by 9 grid of numbers, where each row, each column, and each of the nine 3-by-3 mini-grids, which we'll refer to as sub-boxes, must only contain the digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, these digits must not repeat within any of these constraints. Our goal is to determine if a given board configuration adheres to these rules.

To better understand this, picture the Sudoku board as divided into three distinct areas of concern. First, there are the rows, where each row should have no duplicate digits. Next, the columns follow the same rule — no repeated numbers. Finally, let's consider the nine 3-by-3 sub-boxes distributed across the board. Each of these sub-boxes must also contain unique digits, which adds an additional layer of complexity because positions within these boxes do not always align with straightforward row and column division.

The board can be partially filled, which means some cells might be empty and marked with a period. Our task is merely to validate the current configuration, disregarding whether the puzzle is solvable in its entirety. We only consider cells that are filled when validating.

Approaching this problem demands clarity. An initial, more straightforward idea could be to iterate through each row, column, and sub-box separately, checking for duplicates. For each filled cell, you can imagine tracking which numbers have already been seen in each context using a set of some sort.

One intuitive way to enhance this process involves using a unique way to track these checks. Envision creating a distinct identifier or tagging system. For instance, as you explore each cell, you can tag the presence of a number in its respective row, column, and sub-box. If ever you attempt to tag a number that has already been tagged within that row, column, or sub-box, that indicates a rule has been violated.

For those familiar with data structures like sets or maps, leveraging them can simplify this tracking. They ensure quick look-ups to check if a number has already been seen while maintaining clarity in your validation strategy. This is more efficient than naive repeated scanning of the row, column, or sub-box for each cell.

Ultimately, the challenge of validating a Sudoku configuration lies in juggling these three overlapping constraints simultaneously — rows, columns, and sub-boxes — without becoming overwhelmed by the complexity. Developing a systematic approach allows you to tackle the problem efficiently, avoiding nested loops or redundant checks whenever possible. This not only aligns well with computational efficiency but also mirrors the elegance of a puzzle-solving process, adding depth to your understanding of algorithm design.
