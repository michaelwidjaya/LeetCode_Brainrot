# Explanation for 06.ProductOfArrayExceptSelf

Imagine we have a list of numbers, and our task is to create a new list such that each element in this new list is the product of every number in the original list, except for the number at that same position. If we consider this problem at face value, our first instinct might be to calculate the total product of all the numbers and then simply divide that product by each original number to get the desired result. However, we can't use division, so we'll need another strategy.

To solve this without division and in linear time, a more insightful approach relies on leveraging prefix and suffix products. Let's break down the thought process. 

Firstly, consider the idea of prefix products. Start from the beginning of the list and move towards the end, calculating the product of all numbers up to each point. For example, if our list is [1, 2, 3, 4], then the prefix products would be [1, 1, 2, 6]. Each element in this prefix product array represents the product of all numbers before the current index.

Simultaneously, think about suffix products, which we calculate by starting from the end of the list and moving to the beginning. This time, we create another similar array where each value is the product of all elements after the current index. For our example list, the suffix products would be [24, 12, 4, 1].

Now, here's the elegant part. To find the result for any position in the list, we multiply the prefix product from the left of that position by the suffix product from the right. The result is the product of every other element except the one at the current position. In essence, for each position, we are cleverly consolidating the products before and after it, which gives us the desired result without ever explicitly removing any single element from consideration.

Walking through a quick example, say our input is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Our prefix array is [1, 1, 2, 6], and our suffix array is [24, 12, 4, 1]. The final product array, which combines these insights, would be [24, 12, 8, 6], representing the product of all elements except the one at each index.

This solution is not only correct and efficient, taking linear time, but it also beautifully demonstrates the power of algorithmic thinking to manipulate data in place, considering constraints and refining ideas for an optimal outcome.
