# Explanation for 09.BinaryTreeRightSideView

Imagine standing on the rightmost edge of a wide building. Now, look at the series of rooms in front of you, arranged in a hierarchical structure like a tree. What we're interested in is simply the rooms you can see directly from your vantage point on the right side — those that are not obscured by any others. When we're given a binary tree, our goal is analogous: identify the nodes on the rightmost edge, from top to bottom, of this figurative building.

The core idea is to understand how these nodes appear if you imagine visualizing the tree from the side. We're not just picking the right child nodes; we must account for any node visible because of an absence of others that might otherwise obscure them. This distinction can make it tricky initially because it involves a bit of spatial reasoning about the tree structure.

To solve this problem effectively, let's build intuition starting with its most fundamental operations. A brute force approach could involve using a depth-first search to traverse each root-to-leaf path to determine which nodes form the boundary when observed from the right. This might involve noting the depth and rightmost nodes initially encountered. However, while this might work, it's not the most efficient.

A more elegant approach involves processing the tree level by level, which naturally lends itself to breadth-first search paradigms. Imagine processing each level from left to right but taking note of the last node we encounter at each level, which would naturally be the rightmost node. By sequentially adding just these rightmost nodes, we can directly construct our view from the right. This approach is efficient because it ensures every node is visited exactly once, and every level's processing inspects each node at that level, capturing the view without unnecessary overhead.

Visualize a queue that helps manage our exploration of the tree, maintaining the nodes at the upcoming level to be visited. As we process each node, we add its children to the queue. When we finish each level, the last node we processed is precisely the node we would see from the right.

Transitioning from an initial, naive approach to this level-order traversal clarifies our understanding of the tree's structure — ensuring we aren't focused on individual node connections but rather the shape the tree projects when approached from the side. The benefit here is its manageability in both thought and implementation: each tree node is only enqueued and processed once, meaning our solution is scalable and efficient concerning both time and space.

This methodology effectively balances clarity and efficiency, ensuring our rightmost view is derived directly and intuitively. The result is a precise listing of visible nodes when viewing this tree from the right, capturing not only the nodes themselves but the structural elegance of how they connect in the broader hierarchy.
