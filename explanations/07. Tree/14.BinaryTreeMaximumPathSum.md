# Explanation for 14.BinaryTreeMaximumPathSum

Imagine we're dealing with what's essentially a treasure map embedded in a binary tree. Each node on this map contains a value, which could be positive or negative, representing treasures or traps. Our task is to discover the maximum treasure we can gather by traversing any continuous path through the tree. This path doesn't even have to start at the root or cover an end leaf, providing us with the flexibility to start and end anywhere within the tree's interconnected nodes.

To solve this, we must understand the kind of paths we can traverse. For instance, if you start at any given node, you might consider going down towards its left child, its right child, or possibly through both if your path wants to capture the current node's full potential. In some cases, the best choice might even be to consider the node alone if surrounding nodes lead to a negative sum, akin to quicksand pulling down our potential treasure.

Now, let's imagine walking through the map. At each node, we want to calculate the maximum potential treasure we can acquire by incorporating this node and possibly some of its descendants. We break this down into two key decisions: one, calculating the maximum path sum that includes this node and possibly either one of its children; two, figuring out the maximum of the sums derived from paths that go left, right, and through the current node entirely. By comparing these possibilities, we can decide which gives us the largest path sum if this node were the peak or turning point of our treasure hunt.

But what if our tree is bent or skewed? Every time we calculate a path's potential at a node, we're dealing with depths that differ, which affects the type of paths we explore. The beauty of the recursive approach shines here—it's a strategy where smaller subproblems solve bigger ones. At every node, we consider subpath solutions from left and right children, letting us build upward and eventually grasp the treetop's maximum treasure, or in other words, the tree-rooted optimality naturally emerges from the ground up.

Our quest doesn't just stop at bookkeeping node values—the challenge lies in dynamically maintaining our maximum path sum as we explore each node's unique potential. The elegance stems from this simultaneous calculation, ensuring that at any point during our journey through the nodes, we can confidently say the maximum sum encountered is indeed the best possible treasure haul.

So, with this insight and recursive foresight, we see our solution take form: a harmonious balance between exploring individual paths and synthesizing these to unveil an overarching path sum that cannot be bested. The result is a treasure acquired by deft recursive navigation, cleverly capturing potential at every juncture and maximizing it cumulatively across the entire tree structure. This finely tuned orchestration culminates in solving the problem with optimal time efficiency—catering directly to our goal of hitting the maximum path sum in a manner that's both thoughtful and computationally savvy.
