# Explanation for 07.FindMedianFromDataStream

Imagine you have a continuously growing list of numbers arriving one by one, and you need to consistently find the median of that list. The median, as you know, is the middle value in a collection of numbers that have been sorted. If there's an odd number of numbers, it's simply the middle one. If even, it is the average of the two middle numbers.

Now, let's dive into how we can effectively determine the median at any point, even as more numbers are added. The naive approach would be to store the numbers and sort the list every time we want to find the median. However, this would be inefficient, especially as the list becomes large, because sorting has a time complexity of approximately N log N for each request, where N is the number of elements. This isn't ideal when we're dealing with potentially tens of thousands of operations.

To address this, a more optimal solution involves using a data structure that allows us to efficiently balance and retrieve the middle elements without needing to completely sort the list at every step. This is where the concept of two heaps, or priority queues, becomes very useful.

Visualize the flow of incoming numbers being split into two groups: a max heap and a min heap. The max heap, often called the "low" heap, contains the smaller half of the numbers, while the min heap, the "high" heap, contains the larger half. In the max heap, the largest number is easily accessible, while in the min heap, the smallest number is right at the top.

Now, as each new number comes in, we need to decide which heap it belongs to. If it's larger than or equal to the smallest number in the min heap or if our max heap is empty, the number goes into the min heap. Otherwise, it goes into the max heap. What makes this approach elegant is how we handle maintaining balance between the heaps. We aim for the max heap to not exceed the size of the min heap by more than one element. If it does, we move the largest element from the max heap into the min heap, and vice versa if the min heap grows too large. This ensures that at any given time, our two heaps are nearly balanced in size.

With this structure, determining the median is straightforward. If the total number of elements is odd, the largest number in the max heap directly gives us the median. If it's even, the median is the average of the largest number from the max heap and the smallest from the min heap.

This dual heap method is efficient because it balances the incoming numbers in a way that finding the median takes constant time, while adding a number takes logarithmic time, due to heap operations. This is a significant improvement over repeatedly sorting a list, especially as the volume of data grows.

Additionally, if most numbers are in a small range, say between 0 and 100, optimization can be achieved by adjusting how numbers are distributed across the heaps to ensure consistency. In any case, this structured approach using heaps facilitates a powerful and scalable solution to the median-finding problem.
