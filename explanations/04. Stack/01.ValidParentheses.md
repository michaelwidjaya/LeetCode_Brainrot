# Explanation for 01.ValidParentheses

Imagine you have a string composed solely of three types of brackets: round brackets, square brackets, and curly braces. Your goal is to determine whether this string is valid based on two simple rules: each opening bracket must be paired with a matching closing bracket, and these pairs must be closed in the correct sequence.

To develop some intuition, consider the analogy of a stack of dishes. When we add or remove dishes, the most recent one placed is the first to come off. Similarly, as we traverse the string, we view the characters as dishes being placed into the stack. Whenever we encounter an opening bracket, it goes on the stack because we're waiting to find its matching closing bracket. When we see a closing bracket, we check the top of the stack to see if it matches the type of bracket and remove it if it does.

Let's start by considering a naive approach to clarify why the stack is a fitting model for this problem. If we begin from the start of the string and simply pair each opening bracket with a subsequent closing one, we might make correct pairs but miss the crucial detail of nesting order. For example, in a string like "([])", although each pair matches correctly, the order matters when another bracket type intercedes.

The intuition behind the stack data structure is its Last-In-First-Out principle, which naturally fits the nesting nature of the problem. As we examine each character in the string, we push opening brackets onto the stack to remember them as pending partners. Upon encountering a closing bracket, we check if it correctly matches the bracket at the top of the stack. If it does, this match indicates the pair is complete, and we pop it off. If at any point there's a mismatch or an attempt to check a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, we know immediately the string isn't valid. 

Lastly, after processing the entire string, we verify the stack is empty. If it still contains any unmatched opening brackets, this means there wasn't a corresponding closing bracket, indicating an imbalance in our parentheses structure.

By utilizing this stack approach, we achieve an optimal solution that efficiently checks validity by leveraging the inherent properties of stacks. This strategy smoothly balances the goal of matching types with the requirement of maintaining the correct order, delivering both robust and elegant handling of the task.
