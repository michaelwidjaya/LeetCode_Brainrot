# Explanation for 07.LargestRectangleInHistogram

Imagine you're presented with a row of buildings in a city skyline, where each building has its own height but with a uniform width. Your task is to determine the largest contiguous rectangular area that you can enclose using some of these buildings. This is a problem you might recognize as finding the largest rectangle in a histogram.

Let's start with the basics. You are given an array of integers where each element represents the height of a bar in a histogram. Your goal is to find the maximum area of a rectangle contained within this histogram. Each bar has a width of one unit, meaning any rectangle you can form will extend over a certain number of these unit-wide bars.

At first glance, a brute force approach might come to mind. One might consider calculating the area for every possible rectangle by considering each pair of bars as the boundary of the rectangle. While feasible for smaller datasets, this method becomes quickly inefficient as the number of possible rectangles grows quadratically with the number of bars. Thus, for a significant number of bars, this approach becomes computationally impractical.

To solve this problem efficiently, consider leveraging a data structure that can help manage and access the bars' heights and indices in a more organized way. This is where the concept of a monotonic stack comes into play, which allows us to efficiently keep track of the indices of the bars in an ordered manner as we iterate through the histogram.

Imagine scanning through the histogram from left to right. As you encounter each bar, you use a stack to keep track of the indices of bars with increasing heights. When you find a bar that breaks this increase, it indicates a potential endpoint for some rectangles. At this point, the bars stored in the stack represent potential heights of rectangles, and you can calculate the areas they form.

By popping elements from the stack when you find a shorter bar, you effectively determine the largest possible rectangle that includes the height at the popped index, using the current index as the right boundary and the new index established by the stack as the left boundary. The key insight here is that as soon as a shorter bar is encountered, the tallest bar's influence on forming a larger rectangle is confined and complete, allowing you to calculate its maximum potential area.

A special consideration must be taken at the end of the iteration when bars still remain in the stack. These bars reach all the way to the end of the histogram, so their potential area can be calculated using the full array length.

This efficient solution capitalizes on maintaining a sorted order and effectively leverages the stack structure to perform what seems like a two-pass calculation. As a result, this method brings down complexity to a linear fashion with respect to the number of bars while also requiring an auxiliary linear space for the stack.

In summary, tackling this problem by using a systematic approach with a monotonic stack not only elegantly manages the problem's inherent constraints but also substantially reduces computational overhead, allowing us to solve for the largest rectangle efficiently even with large input sizes. The combination of logical insight into the problem with appropriate data structure choice is what transforms this difficult problem into a tractable one.
