# Explanation for 05.DailyTemperatures

Imagine that each day you observe the temperature and you're keen on predicting how long it will be until you experience warmer weather. This is the essence of the problem we're solving: given a list of daily temperatures, for each day, determine how many days you'll have to wait until the temperature is warmer. If there's no future day with a warmer temperature, you'll record a zero for that day.

Let's walk through an example for better intuition. Say you have a sequence of temperatures, for instance, 73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, and 73. We'll start by looking at the first temperature, which is 73. We notice that the next day it's 74, a warmer day, so the output here is 1 day. Then, for 74, you check forward and see 75, which is warmer and again only 1 day away, so 1 day is the answer for that as well. For 75, though, you need to wait four days until reaching a higher temperature of 76. So, you'd record a 4 there. You apply a similar thought process for each day.

Now, let’s explore how to smartly tackle this without unnecessary computations. Initially, you could try a straightforward solution by checking each day against all future days, which sounds like you're doing a lot of work since you're comparing each day with every subsequent one. This approach can become inefficient, especially as the number of temperatures grows, making it too slow for large datasets.

To make this more efficient, envision a stack data structure, which is a very handy tool for problems involving comparisons with previous elements. The idea is to traverse the temperature list while using the stack to keep track of days with temperatures you haven’t yet found a warmer day for. As you move forward, you check if the current temperature is warmer than any of the temperatures recorded in the stack. If it is, you found a warmer day for those earlier temperatures, meaning you now know how many days it took and can mark those in your results list accordingly. You continue this process, efficiently finding the answers in a single pass through the temperatures.

This solution is optimal because, in essence, each temperature is pushed and popped from the stack at most once. This leads to a linear time complexity, O(N), where N is the number of temperatures, making it scalable for large input sizes. It's both time-efficient and space-efficient since, in the worst case, the stack could contain all temperatures at once but no more, leading to a space complexity also approaching O(N).

So, through clever management using a stack, you avoid the pitfalls of a brute-force method, achieving both speed and elegance in the solution. This technique exemplifies how understanding data structures can significantly enhance the efficiency of algorithms, particularly by reducing unnecessary work while maintaining clarity of thought.
