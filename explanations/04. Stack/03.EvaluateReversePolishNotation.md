# Explanation for 03.EvaluateReversePolishNotation

Let's delve into the concept of evaluating an arithmetic expression given in Reverse Polish Notation, often simply referred to as RPN. This is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. Unlike the more familiar infix notation, where operators sit between their operands, RPN eliminates the need for parentheses and allows for the expression to be evaluated in a single left-to-right pass.

Imagine you're given a list of tokens representing a mathematical expression. There are two main types of tokens you'll encounter: numbers and operators. Numbers are straightforward, but with operators, things get interesting. The operators we deal with in this context are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Let's be clear that division here implies an integer division with truncation toward zero.

When evaluating an RPN expression, the process is best approached using a stack data structure. A stack is ideal here because it allows us to manage the flow of operands and operators efficiently. As we traverse each token, we push numbers onto the stack and then, when we encounter an operator, we pop the necessary operands, perform the operation, and push the result back on the stack. This process mirrors the way RPN expressions naturally resolve without the need for explicit order of operations or parentheses.

Consider this with an example: "2", "1", "+", "3", "*". Initially, we push 2 and 1 onto the stack. Upon hitting the plus operator, we pop the top two numbers, add them to get 3, and push the result back onto the stack. Now the stack holds the number 3. Next, we push 3 onto the stack from the tokens. When we encounter the multiplication operator, we again pop the top two numbers, multiply them to get 9, and push the result back on the stack. With no more tokens to process, the value left on the stack is our final answer, 9.

This approach handles operations with immediacy and precision. However, a naive way to solve this problem might be to try simulating the operations by tracking indices and performing each operation in sequence. While intuitive, this method lacks scalability and elegance, especially as expressions grow more complex.

By leveraging a stack, our solution becomes both efficient and clean. Each operator performs a constant-time operation with the stack, enabling a linear traverse of the tokens. This approach aligns well with our goal of evaluating potentially lengthy expressions quickly — hence the time complexity is linear in relation to the number of tokens. Similarly, the space complexity is also linear, as the stack could potentially hold every number in the expression in the worst case.

So, through the lens of stack operations, the RPN problem is elegantly tackled, turning what might initially seem like a procedural tangle into a straightforward, structured process. And therein lies the beauty of RPN and the stack mechanism — it transforms complexity into clarity.
