# Explanation for 05.FindMinimumInRotatedSortedArray

Imagine you're working with a sorted array that has been rotated at an unknown pivot point. Your task is to determine the smallest element in this array, and while this might sound straightforward if you just scanned the entire array, you have the additional constraint of solving it efficiently in logarithmic time. This suggests you need to leverage a binary search approach, as logarithmic time complexity is typical of such techniques.

To clearly grasp this, picture an array originally sorted in ascending order: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7. Rotation in practice means taking some initial segment of the array and moving it to the end, such as becoming 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2 if you rotated by four positions. The rotation leaves the array split into two sorted halves, and critically, the minimum element is the pivot dividing these two subarrays.

Now, how do you efficiently find the pivot point where this transition happens and thus locate the minimum element? This is where the binary search idea comes into play. Imagine the standard binary search mechanism – you have pointers at your start and end of your array and a mid-pointer. The key here is to determine which portion of the array is correctly sorted and use that information to decide how to narrow down the search space.

Begin by looking at the mid element in relation to the start and end elements. If the element at the middle is greater than the end element, this tells you that the smallest element must be to the right of this middle position. Conversely, if the mid element is less than the end element, then the minimum is likely on the left. By continuously adjusting your start and end pointers based on this check, the search space halves with each step, converging on the pivot point.

This method ensures you locate the point at which the order breaks from high to low, which is your minimum. It's achieved in O(log n) time, making it highly efficient, leveraging the sorted property throughout the search.

What we've done here is transform a naive linear scan into a clever use of binary search on a rotated structure. By focusing on key elements at strategic positions and understanding which side of your midpoint holds the minimum, you can efficiently home in on the solution. This approach beautifully illustrates the power of adapting familiar search methodologies – like binary search – to novel problem contexts.
