# Explanation for 04.SearchInRotatedSortedArray

Imagine you're given a sorted array that might have been mysteriously rotated at some unknown index. For example, take the array [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7], which is in perfect increasing order. If we rotate it at index 3, it transforms into [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]. Despite the rotation, two things remain true: first, all the original elements are still present, and second, within any subarray that hasn't been rotated, the numbers remain in order.

Your task is to determine the position of a given target value within this rotated array. If the target isn't present, you should indicate that by returning -1. The challenge here is to do this efficiently, aiming for a runtime complexity of O(log n), which suggests using a strategy akin to binary search rather than a straightforward linear search.

The essence of solving this problem lies in modifying the traditional binary search. Typically, binary search works on the fact that the data is perfectly ordered. Here, despite the rotation, significant parts of the array will still exhibit order — they’re just split into two monotonically increasing parts, and at most only one of these parts is affected by the pivot.

Let's explore the intuition behind this approach. Begin by considering the entire array like you would in a binary search, with pointers at the start and end. You’ll evaluate the middle element. If this middle element is your target, you're done. If not, the next task is to identify if the left half or the right half of the current subarray is sorted. In the rotated array, at least one of these halves will be sorted.

If the left half is sorted, and if the target lies within the bounds of this sorted region, you should focus on this area next. If the target is outside this range, shift your attention to the other half. Conversely, if the right half is sorted and the target fits within its limits, continue searching there. If it's outside, the target must be in the opposite unsorted region.

This iterative division and conquering dramatically reduces the part of the array you need to consider, ensuring that the search runs in logarithmic time. The beauty here is recognizing that even with the rotation, the sorted properties are preserved locally, enabling a modified binary search to deftly zero in on the potential location of the target with efficiency and precision.

By always narrowing down the search space using logical checks to determine which half of the array to proceed with next, you maintain the logarithmic runtime you desire, leveraging the partially preserved order characteristic of these rotated arrays. Thus, despite the initial complication introduced by the array's rotation, a clear logical framework allows us to effectively navigate and solve the problem with elegance and efficiency.
