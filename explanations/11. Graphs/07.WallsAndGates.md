# Explanation for 07.WallsAndGates

Imagine you are in a vast mansion with numerous rooms, some of which have impassable walls, while others contain open gates. The mansion is laid out on a grid, and each room in the grid can either be a wall, a gate, or an empty room that has yet to find a connection to a gate. Walls are impenetrable, gates are points of entry or exit, and the empty rooms have the potential to connect to these gates. Your task is to figure out the shortest pathway from each empty room to its nearest gate, akin to finding the way to the nearest exit in a maze.

Let's simplify this problem with an intuitive example. Visualize a miniature version of this mansion where you have a grid with specific values: -1 represents walls; 0 symbolizes gates; and a large number, often set to represent infinity, signifies an empty room. Your goal here is to fill each of these empty rooms in the grid with the number of steps it takes to reach the closest gate. If there's a wall blocking access to the most immediate gate, or if no path exists, this room remains a large number indicative of an infinitely far distance.

Now, the challenge is about how to spread the idea of distance optimally across the grid, much like the ripple effect of a pebble falling into water. One naive concept could be to start from each empty room and search outward to find the nearest gate, measuring and comparing distances to each gate detected. While this brute-force approach works, it is inefficient because it repeats unnecessary computations, akin to individually mapping every room to every gate from scratch.

A more intuitive and efficient strategy leverages the principle of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This powerful tactic is similar to how a fire spreads in open space, expanding layer by layer, exploring all immediate neighbors before moving further. In our grid, BFS allows us to start the search cleanly and methodically from the gates, which are our sources of truth or starting points. We expand outwards, marking each room with the minimal number of steps required to return to a gate.

By systematically queuing up our starting points (the gates), we can ensure that each room's distance is computed only once at the optimal time, using previously computed values as stepping stones. For every step through an adjacent room, if it is reachable and not yet updated, we fill it with the current shortest path distance, allowing this change to cascade through rooms in subsequent steps. This prevents redundant calculations and keeps our operations within manageable bounds both for time and space.

Thus, the BFS approach is not only methodical and natural but also exploits the nature of expanding search fronts, ensuring that we have a mathematically neat and efficient way to solve the puzzle of connecting disparate rooms to gates in a structured and optimal fashion. By employing BFS, we ensure that the distance values propagate outward from gates until they fill the accessible parts of the grid, giving each room its rightful minimum distance to the nearest gate.
