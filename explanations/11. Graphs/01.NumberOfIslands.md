# Explanation for 01.NumberOfIslands

Imagine a grid, much like a map cut into squares, where each square can either represent land, denoted by a '1', or water, denoted by a '0'. Our task is to count how many distinct islands exist on this grid. An island is a group of connected land squares, meaning they are adjacent either vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally. Importantly, these islands are surrounded by water, not touching the border as that is automatically assumed to be water.

For visualization, let's consider walking over the grid with the ability to step only on land squares ('1'). If you started at one piece of land and kept walking to any neighboring land squares, all the ones you can reach without touching water form a single island. If you find another separate piece of land that cannot be reached from the first, that's another island altogether.

To solve this problem efficiently, we can think of it as navigating through the grid. A straightforward approach is to traverse the grid cell by cell. Each time we stumble upon an unvisited land cell, it marks the discovery of a new island. From there, we'll explore this island fully. This exploration can be done through Depth-First Search, where we dive deep into each piece of connected land, marking it as visited so that we don't count parts of the same island more than once. This search can travel up, down, left, and right from any given land cell.

Think of this Depth-First Search as casting a net; you start from one land cell and expand out in all directions, pulling in all that belong to that island as you mark them. Once this net has engulfed an entire island, you count it as one. Then, you continue scanning the grid from where you left off, looking for any other unexplored lands to indicate a new island.

With this understanding, our primary task is to make sure every part of the grid is covered. Thus, each time we engage in a new search, it signifies a new island has been found. This means the number of islands we identify is simply the number of times we engage this thorough search throughout the grid.

In terms of complexity, since each part of the grid will be covered precisely once, our approach will run efficiently enough in linear time, relative to the grid's size. It will also require memory proportional to the grid's size to track which parts have already been visited. Understanding these aspects not only helps solve this problem but gives you a strong basis for tackling similar problems where connectivity and traversal are key.
