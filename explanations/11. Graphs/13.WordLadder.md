# Explanation for 13.WordLadder

Imagine you're tasked with transforming a starting word into a target word, but you must do this step-by-step, altering just one letter each time. Furthermore, every intermediate word you create with each step must be a valid word from a given list. This transformation journey begins at the 'beginWord', and we need to find our way to the 'endWord'. Our challenge is to find the shortest possible sequence of transformations.

To make it a bit more challenging, if you can't reach the end word with the given list of words, you should report that the task is impossible. For instance, starting with the word "hit" and needing to end up with "cog", all while using valid transformations from a set of words like "hot," "dot," "dog," and others.

Let's break down the problem and think about how we approach it conceptually. A very natural way to explore possibilities in problems like this, where you have potential paths through a network of related elements, is using graph theory. Here, each word can be seen as a node, and there's a connection, an edge, between two nodes if you can change one word into the other by altering exactly one letter. 

Think about constructing a transformation network. You begin with building links between words that differ by one letter, meaning two words are neighbors if you can change one to the other by modifying a single character. For example, "hit" can change to "hot" if both are in your word list because they only differ by the letter in the middle.

Once you have this relationship network or graph established, where nodes are words and edges exist between them based on single-letter changes, you can leverage a Breadth-First Search (BFS) strategy. BFS is particularly suitable here because it explores all possibilities at the current level before moving deeper — thus it naturally explores shorter transformation paths first. Essentially, BFS helps us efficiently explore the word connections starting from the 'beginWord', layer by layer, looking for the shortest path to 'endWord'.

As you unreel this BFS, you'd maintain a record of the words you've previously visited to avoid redundant exploration. This also helps prevent cycles, ensuring we do not revisit words unnecessarily and thereby keep the search efficient. Keep track of the level or depth you are at since each level corresponds to one step or transformation. Once you stumble upon the 'endWord', the level number tells you the exact number of transformations required to reach it from your 'beginWord'. 

The beauty of this is that if the end word is not in your initial connections, BFS will explore all possibilities and eventually tell you it’s unreachable by emptying its queue without success.

In summary, the pathfinding process hinges on representing words and their transformations as a graph and navigating through it strategically to identify the shortest transformation sequence. When done correctly, this approach allows us to handle even the large lists of words swiftly, embracing efficient exploration and sharp decision-making.
