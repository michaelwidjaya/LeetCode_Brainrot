# Explanation for 04.PacificAtlanticWaterFlow

Imagine an island represented as a grid, where each cell has a specified height. Along the perimeter of this grid lie two grand oceans: the Pacific, touching the top and left edges, and the Atlantic, along the right and bottom. Our challenge is to determine which cells of this island allow rainwater to flow into both of these mighty bodies of water. Essentially, we're looking for spots from which water can make its way to both oceans purely by moving from a higher elevation to a lower or equal one.

This setup allows us to visualize a fascinating natural process: rainwater cascading down the heights, seeking lower elevations, finally reaching a body of water. The critical insight here is understanding how water, starting from a particular cell, can flow downhill toward the oceans. For a cell to drain to both oceans, it must have pathways, or flow chains, leading to both the Pacific and the Atlantic.

To untangle this challenge, let's consider a high-level approach. We'll employ depth-first search techniques, starting from the ocean borders and working inwards. Imagine standing at the Pacific border: your task is to map out all reachable cells based on decreasing heights. Think of the Atlantic border similarly. By doing so, we identify all the cells that can drain into each respective ocean.

Here's the interesting part: we look for the intersection of these two sets of cells. This intersection will be our ultimate answer, as it represents the locations that can potentially siphon water towards both oceans.

Intuitively, you're casting two nets: one starting from the Pacific and another from the Atlantic. Each net catches all accessible cells based on the slope of the terrain. The overlap between these nets is precisely what we're searching for. By approaching it this way, you efficiently map out viable paths, mirroring how water naturally seeks the path of least resistance toward the ocean.

This method breaks down the problem into manageable parts and leverages the natural starting pointsâ€”the ocean borders themselves. The exploration of heights, coupled with our depth-first searches, is both conceptual and organic, much like water tracing its way downhill. This strategic movement from brute-force conceptualization to a more elegant, interconnected approach provides not only a solution but also an understanding of how water interaction with topography can be simulated in grids. It's a harmonious blend of nature's logic and algorithmic precision.
