# Explanation for 05.SurroundedRegions

Imagine you are standing in front of a large grid filled with two types of tokens, 'X' and 'O'. Your task is to identify and flip all 'O' tokens that are completely surrounded by 'X' tokens on the grid on all four sides. This means that if there is an 'O' token that can trace a path to the border of the grid without crossing an 'X', we must leave it unchanged. However, any 'O's that are confined within an enclosure of 'X's, unable to reach a border, need to be transformed into 'X's.

To build an intuition for this, let's first consider the simplest scenario: a small section of the grid. Assume you have a couple of 'O's in the middle of the board with 'X's surrounding them fully. It's clear that these 'O's cannot escape to the edge, hence should be flipped to 'X's. Now, if the grid is massive and you're working with intricate patterns, it can become non-trivial to visually track such enclosures.

A naive approach might be to traverse the entire grid and inspect each 'O', probing around it to see if it can directly or indirectly reach an edge without touching an 'X'. This would be computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundant checks and re-checks for paths we've already evaluated.

To solve this problem efficiently, we leverage a critical observation: Any 'O' connected to an 'O' on the border cannot be captured. Thus, if we think of these border-connected 'O's as one large safe path, our goal is to identify all such paths quickly and avoid flipping these.

To achieve this optimal solution, consider using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) starting from every 'O' that sits on the edge of the grid. We explore in four directions—left, right, up, and down—marking all reachable 'O's from these starting points. By doing so, we effectively trace out and preserve all regions connected to the border 'O's.

Once this marking process completes, any 'O' that remains unmarked is surely trapped, surrounded by 'X's, and needs to be flipped. This method avoids redundant exploration, focusing only on essential checks, and can be achieved in linear time relative to the grid's size, making our solution both elegant and efficient.

This guided exploration empowers us to tackle large grids confidently, knowing each step incrementally works towards the goal, transforming the challenge from a daunting maze-solving task into a systematic delineation of boundaries.
