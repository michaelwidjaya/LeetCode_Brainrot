# Explanation for 08.ValidParenthesisString

Consider the problem of verifying if a given string composed of the characters ‘(’, ‘)’, and ‘*’ is valid based on parenthesis matching rules. This task boils down to determining whether every left parenthesis can be paired with a corresponding right parenthesis, adhering to the correct order. The twist here is that the asterisk, '*', adds versatility—it can either represent a left parenthesis, a right parenthesis, or be completely ignored.

The challenge of the problem lies in the multiple roles that the asterisk can play. Therefore, we need a strategic approach to make sure we account for all possible interpretations of each asterisk within the string while ensuring the overall structure remains balanced.

Let’s first explore a basic concept of balance. Imagine you're reading the string from left to right: what you'd like to ensure is that at any point, the number of closing parentheses doesn’t exceed the opening ones, as this would imply an imbalance. This works well in simple parenthesis strings without asterisks.

However, the asterisk introduces ambiguity. To manage this, consider using two parameters as you traverse the string: one representing the minimum possible count of open parentheses, and the other as the maximum. This reflects the scenario most pessimistic for closing too soon and the most optimistic about how many unmatched open parentheses you could have at any point.

Here's how this dual approach helps: every time you encounter an opening parenthesis, you simply increment both counts since it definitely opens a new potential for closure. With every closing parenthesis, you decrement both, as it closes an existing opening.

The complication with an asterisk unfolds across its flexibility. It can decrement the minimum count (in case it’s considered a closing parenthesis), increment the maximum count (if it's an opening parenthesis), or leave the counts unchanged (if ignored). Maintaining these minimum and maximum bounds ensures that we neither unintentionally allow an early over-closing nor disregard possible unmatched openings.

Moreover, to handle situations where closing parentheses might lead the minimum count into negative, we don't let it fall below zero, which conceptually means we're not allowing the string to superfluously close parentheses before they can legally occur.

As you reach the end of the string, the minimum possible open count being zero indicates that there exists at least one valid interpretation of asterisks such that all parentheses are correctly matched.

By leveraging this conceptual strategy, you transform what could be an exponential computational challenge into efficient linear traversal, keeping track of potential imbalance without ever needing recursive consideration of all interpretations. This reflects how understanding the problem deeply can streamline your approach from the naive backtracking solution to an optimal, linear time solution.
