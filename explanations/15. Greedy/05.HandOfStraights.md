Imagine we have a collection of cards, and each card has a number on it. Your goal is to figure out if you can take these cards and form them into groups, where each group has a specific number of cards, called groupSize. But it's not just about any random groups; each group must consist of consecutive numbers. So, if you have a group of size three, those three cards must be numbers like 1, 2, 3 or 4, 5, 6, and not, say, 1, 3, 5. 

Let's think about how we approach this problem. If the total number of cards isn't a multiple of the group size, it's impossible to form such groups, so that's our first check. It ensures we don't waste effort where no solution exists from the start.

Next, think about consecutive numbers. Our best plan is to work with the smallest numbers first. Imagine we organize the cards to see what's least, then try to build groups starting from there. You'd aim to use up all the cards of the same value as much as possible. We're like a puzzle solver looking to fit pieces in the smallest starting point available.

To flesh out this idea a bit more, picture using a frequency map to track how many cards you have of each number. This map is crucial because it tells you how many you can use in creating your groups. You need to use an ordered structure to ensure you're always considering the next smallest available number, which will help you form valid consecutive sequences.

Now, as you create groups, start with the smallest available card, which your ordering provides, and attempt to build out a group of the desired size moving upwards in consecutive order. If a consecutive number is missing or you've run out of the needed card, then the arrangement isn't possible. Conversely, if you can form all necessary groups without being blocked, then it's possible to rearrange the cards in the way required.

To visualize, imagine starting with the smallest card, like the number 1. You use 1, then need 2 and 3 to complete a group. Each time you successfully use a card, you decrement its count. If you run out of a number before completing the group, you'll need to stop as a gap would mean it's impossible to continue finding a complete sequence of that size.

With these steps, you're forming a coherent strategy. Initially, it might seem intuitive to grab anything available, but focusing on both the ordering and frequency allows you to systematically and efficiently check if rearrangement is feasible. This transition from a brute-force grab to a methodical structured approach is what takes you from a naive attempt towards an efficient solution.

Finally, always remember that every elegant solution in computer science relies on finding the right structures to utilize. In this case, ordering and tracking frequencies were key -- providing a way to find and validate potential groups efficiently. Thus, with a logical approach and ordered thinking, you come to a solution thatâ€™s both reasoned and robust.
