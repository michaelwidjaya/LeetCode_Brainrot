# Explanation for 02.Jump

Imagine you're standing at the beginning of a long row of stepping stones, each labeled with a number. This number indicates how many stones forward you can potentially jump from your current position. Your goal is to determine whether it's possible to skip from stone to stone and reach the very last one.

Consider the first example where the stones are marked [2,3,1,1,4]. Starting from the very first stone marked with a 2, you have the option to jump either to the next stone or the one after that. By choosing to jump to the next stone where the label is a 3, you gain the ability to jump further, skipping multiple stones if needed. You choose to leap all the way to the last stone, successfully completing the task.

Contrast this with another scenario where the stones are labeled [3,2,1,0,4]. Here, you begin with a powerful jump of up to 3 stones ahead. However, each subsequent stone offers a decreasing range of movement until you reach the fourth stone, labeled 0, which effectively traps you. From this position, there's no possible way forward to the fourth stone, labeled with a 4. Thus, you can't reach the last stone, making it clear that achieving the goal is impossible in this scenario.

So, how do you determine if you can successfully hop across these stones without simulating every possible sequence of jumps? Begin by conceptualizing a naive approach: starting from the first stone and trying all possible jumps, but soon you'll find this computationally expensive and infeasible as the number of stones grows. The strategy becomes inefficient very quickly.

Instead, consider a cleverer method. Think of maintaining a variable that keeps track of the furthest stone you can reach at any point in time, let's call it a "reachability index." As you move along the stones, update this index whenever a jump from the current stone allows you to go farther. If your reachability index grows to cover the last stone, you can definitively conclude it’s possible to reach the goal.

The beauty of this strategy is akin to gradually expanding a safety net. As long as you're not left behind any stone beyond your current reach, you keep extending your reach further and further. If at any point, your reachability index is less than your current position, that indicates you've hit a snag — like standing on a stone and realizing you can't hop forward anymore, ensuring your journey is doomed before reaching the end.

This efficient method is not only intuitive but computationally optimal, running in a linear pass through the stones while only needing a simple variable to track reachability, consuming constant space. The elegance of this solution lies in its simplicity, merging the ease of tracking potential jumps with the clever expansion of your reachable horizon. This way, you determine the possibility of completing your stone-hopping adventure with confidence and ease.
