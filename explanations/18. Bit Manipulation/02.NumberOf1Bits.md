# Explanation for 02.NumberOf1Bits

Imagine you have a pendant with bits inscribed on it. Each bit is like a small jewel, either lit up or dark. Our task here is to count how many of these jewels are lit up — that is, how many of the bits, in a binary representation of a number, are set to '1'.

Now, here's a classical question: Given a number represented in binary form, how can we effectively determine how many '1's exist in that representation? This question often appears in technical interviews because it tests your understanding of binary arithmetic and bit manipulation — both fundamental computer science concepts that are widely applicable.

Let's start with the most straightforward approach. Imagine you have this 32-lamp row, and you want to check, one by one, if each lamp is on. This would involve examining each bit of the binary string sequentially, starting from one end to the other, and simply keeping a tally of how often you see a '1'. At first glance, this seems logical – a direct and clear solution. However, it's not the most efficient, especially if you're counting bits in a context where speed is crucial, like in high-frequency computation settings.

Now let me introduce you to a more refined and potent tool in your algorithm toolkit: a bit manipulation technique using the AND operation. Here's the insight: consider what happens when you take a number and perform a bitwise AND with the number minus one. This operation has a magic-like property: it actually turns off the rightmost '1' in the current binary representation. So, if you repeatedly apply this operation and count how many times you can do it before the number becomes zero, what you're effectively doing is counting the '1' bits, because each operation removes one of them.

Why is this method optimal? The beauty of this technique lies in its efficiency. In contrast to the naïve method, where you check all 32 bits one after the other, here you only perform operations as many times as there are '1' bits in the number — much faster for numbers with few '1's. And remember, each operation not only counts but also transforms the number by stripping bits away, which aligns beautifully with our goal of counting.

Let's reflect on a practical scenario to solidify this understanding. If you're given a number like in the third example, with a large majority of '1' bits, employing this method means you spend just enough time proportional to the bits that are set, not the full length of the bit string. This efficiency becomes even more pronounced when you consider the follow-up constraint: optimizing for repeated calls. This bit manipulation method naturally fits the requirement, as its speed provides both immediate gains and scales well without additional overhead. 

In summary, starting with a clear understanding of what each bit represents encourages a strategic approach to tackling the problem with elegance and efficiency. Transitioning from checking each bit manually to leveraging bit operations exemplifies how stepping back and understanding the properties of your tools can lead to significant improvements in solving computational problems.
