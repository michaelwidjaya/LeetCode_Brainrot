# Explanation for 01.SingleNumber

Imagine you're handed a bag full of socks, where you know each sock has a matching partner except for one lonely sock. Your task is to identify that single sock. This is essentially what the "Single Number" problem asks us to solve, but instead of socks, we're dealing with numbers in an array. We know each number pairs up with an identical number, except for one number that stands alone. Our goal is to find this outlier.

Let's start by considering our constraints. We need to devise a solution that processes the array in linear time, or O(n), meaning a single pass over the data should suffice. Additionally, we're asked to use constant space, indicating that we shouldn't use extra memory that scales with the size of our input, like additional data structures that grow as the input grows.

First, let's think about how you'd naturally approach such a problem. An initial, albeit less efficient, idea might be to count the occurrences of each number, then identify the one that appears just once. However, this approach likely involves either hashing or sorting, both of which conflict with the problem requirements due to their space or time complexities.

To arrive at the optimal solution, we must tap into the properties of numbers. A particularly valuable tool here is the bitwise XOR operation. XOR has some fascinating characteristics: if you XOR two identical numbers, the result is zero. Additionally, XORing any number with zero leaves it unchanged. This means XOR is inherently able to cancel out identical numbers, which forms the crux of our clever strategy.

Let's apply this to our problem. As we iterate over the array, we can XOR each number with a running result. Initially, set this result to zero. As we proceed, numbers that occur twice will cancel each other out through the XOR operation, ultimately leaving us with the number that doesnâ€™t repeat. This operation exploits both the linearity in time and the constancy in space requirements effectively.

To visualize, consider an example array: [2, 2, 1]. Starting with zero, XOR with 2 gives us 2. XOR again with another 2 brings us back to zero, because 2 XOR 2 equals zero. Finally, XOR with 1 leaves us with 1, hence revealing the single number.

In essence, by leveraging the properties of XOR, we achieve an elegant and optimal solution that adheres perfectly to the constraints given. This approach is a classic case of how understanding fundamental concepts can lead to simple yet powerful solutions in computer science.
