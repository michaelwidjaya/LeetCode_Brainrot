# Explanation for 03.CountingBits

Let's dive into this intriguing problem that challenges us to explore the binary world of numbers. Imagine you have a number, n, and your task is to determine how many 1s are there in the binary representation of each integer from 0 up to n. The goal is to return an array where each element corresponds to the count of these 1s in the binary representation of its index. To elucidate through an example, if n is 5, you want an array that has elements for 0 through 5, like [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2].

Now, consider the binary counting game. We start with 0, which in binary is simply '0', no 1s present. As we increment to 1, the binary becomes '1', consisting of a single 1. For the number 2, its binary form is '10', which, if you inspect closely, contains one 1. Number 3 translates to '11', which bumps the count up to two 1s. Moving to 4, or '100', we revert back to a single 1.

At first glance, you might consider the straightforward approach: for each number, convert it to binary, and count the 1s. This method is intuitive but rather inefficient, given we'd be processing each number individually with operations that can grow large as n increases. This gives us a time complexity that could be as high as O(n log n), owing to the conversion and counting for each number.

But let's explore a more elegant and efficient path. Notice a pattern: the number of 1s in a binary representation can often be derived from a previously computed value. Here's where the concept of dynamic programming shines. Think about this: the binary representation for an even number is essentially the binary of its half appended with a 0. For instance, 4 ('100') is derived from 2 ('10'). Therefore, an even number has the same number of 1s as its half. For odd numbers, it's almost the same story with a twist. An odd number is just one more than an even number, meaning its binary form is like its predecessor's binary with an additional 1 at the least significant bit position. For example, 5 ('101') comes from 4 ('100') plus that extra 1.

Let's connect the dots to outline what we're aiming at: a dynamic programming array where each position i holds the count of 1s for that particular number. For every even number, you'd look back to i/2 and adopt its count, while for an odd number, you'd take i-1's count and simply add 1.

This approach cleverly builds up from 0 to n in a linear fashion, leveraging computed results to work out the current, considerably enhancing the efficiency to O(n). By doing so, it not only optimizes the process but also underlines the power of recognizing patterns and decomposing a problem based on prior solutions. This mindset is essential in crafting solutions that are not just correct but elegantly efficient. So, next time you're faced with such a problem, think about the relationship between elements and how you can iteratively build up your solution using precomputed data.
