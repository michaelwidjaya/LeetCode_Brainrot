# Explanation for 02.LongestCommonSubsequence

Imagine you have two strings, and your task is to determine the longest sequence of characters that appears in both strings in the same order, although not necessarily consecutively. This is what we call the Longest Common Subsequence, or LCS. For example, given the strings "abcde" and "ace," the LCS is "ace" because all of these characters appear in both strings and follow the same order.

So, what makes the LCS problem interesting and worth solving? It's because identifying common patterns within different sequences, like these strings, is a core challenge in fields ranging from bioinformatics to text comparison tools. Let’s break down how we might conceptualize and solve this.

Initially, you might think of comparing each character of the first string to every character of the second string, looking for alignment at each step. While this kind of brute-force approach might work for small strings, it quickly becomes inefficient as the strings grow in length, since we’d be dealing with a time complexity that scales exponentially with the length of the strings.

To tackle this more efficiently, we utilize a strategy known as dynamic programming, which helps us break down complex problems into simpler subproblems and remember our previous solutions to avoid redundant work. Imagine setting up a grid. Each cell in this grid represents a state that answers the question: "What is the length of the longest common subsequence considering substrings up to these specific points in each string?" 

To populate this grid, start by comparing characters of the strings at all possible positions. If the characters are the same, it signals a possible extension of a subsequence found so far, so you carry over the existing subsequence length and add one, corresponding to the new matching character. This is where the magic of dynamic programming truly shines — by utilizing results we've already computed for smaller problems, we efficiently build towards our solution for the entire strings.

When characters do not match, the previous solution length must be preserved, which prompts considering the maximum value from either ignoring the current character of one string or the other. This means looking at prior solutions where either the character from the first string was excluded or the character from the second string was excluded. By always choosing the maximum length found this way, you incrementally build the longest common subsequence.

Ultimately, through methodical filling of this table, the final cell gives the length of the longest common subsequence for the entire strings. This approach ensures that each character is examined enough to guarantee accuracy but not so much that the solution becomes inefficient.

In terms of complexity, this dynamic programming approach uses a table proportional to the product of the lengths of the two strings, making it manageable even as input sizes approach their constraints. This balance between clarity and efficiency makes understanding and applying dynamic programming solutions like this one both powerful and educational. By systematically constructing solutions to subproblems and leveraging those to solve larger ones, dynamic programming turns potentially prohibitive computations into practical solutions.
