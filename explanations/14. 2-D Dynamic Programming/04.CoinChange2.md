# Explanation for 04.CoinChange2

Imagine you're at a carnival with a bag full of coins, each of different denominations, and you're trying to find out how many different ways you can use these coins to pay for exactly five dollars worth of games. You need to consider various combinations and permutations of these coins to achieve exactly that amount. That's the crux of the coin change problem we're tackling.

Let's dive deeper into our scenario. Instead of five dollars, let's say you can have an arbitrary total amount you're aiming to reach. Now, what makes this intriguing is that you can use an unlimited number of each type of coin. This opens up a multitude of possibilities for how you can combine them to make the exact amount required.

For instance, consider you have coins in denominations of one, two, and five. To make five dollars, you could do it with one five-dollar coin, or two two-dollar coins and a one-dollar coin, or any other such combination that gives the total as five. The challenge is to compute all the distinct ways you might reach that total.

Initially, an obvious, albeit less efficient, approach might be to explore all possible sets of coins, starting by trying every combination. However, this quickly unfolds into a computational nightmare as the number of coins and target amount grow. The problem with this brute-force method is that it doesnâ€™t scale elegantly, creating a performance bottleneck as it redundantly computes the same possibilities over and over.

To enhance this process, we turn to dynamic programming. This technique effectively breaks the problem into simpler sub-problems, reuses solutions to sub-problems where possible, and constructs the solution to the overall problem incrementally. Think of it as strategically planning your coin usage in steps, storing results of previously calculated smaller amounts and reapplying these results as building blocks for larger amounts.

To break it down further, we conceptualize a table where one axis represents the different coin denominations and the other represents amounts from zero up to the target amount. The intersections of these lines will store the number of ways we can make up that specific amount using the available coins up to that denomination. It's a bottom-up approach: we begin from zero and build our way up to the desired total amount.

This technique's beauty lies in its efficiency and elegance compared to the naive method. For each coin, we systematically add ways to form amounts incrementally, using the coin itself alongside combinations found with smaller amounts. This makes it possible to capture the essence of all potential setups without redundant calculations.

In terms of complexity, this approach is guided by the product of the number of coins and the target amount, providing a much faster and more manageable path to the solution than listing and evaluating every possible combination. Furthermore, optimal strategies simplify the space complexity significantly, using a single array to track possible ways to achieve each amount, progressing through the range incrementally.

This systematic manner of exploring combinations using dynamic programming not only solves the problem efficiently but also provides deep insight into the art of optimizing recursive problems. By employing these strategic steps, we transform what could have been a cumbersome task into a sleek and insightful exploration of combinatorial mathematics in action.
