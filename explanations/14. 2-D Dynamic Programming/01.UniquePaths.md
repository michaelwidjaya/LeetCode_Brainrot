# Explanation for 01.UniquePaths

Imagine a robot standing at the top-left corner of an m by n grid, and it wants to reach the bottom-right corner. However, it's only allowed two types of moves: it can either go one step right or one step down. This problem asks us to find how many distinct paths this robot can take to accomplish its goal.

Let's build some intuition. Consider a grid where m equals 3 and n equals 7, like in our first example. Here, the robot is starting in the top-left of a 3-row by 7-column grid and needs to wind its way down to the opposite corner, restricted to only moving right or down at each step. If we visualize it, each complete path to the bottom-right corner is a unique combination of right and down moves, precisely 2 downs and 5 rights in any order. Each arrangement forms a distinct path, making it a combinatorial problem.

So, how do we efficiently calculate the number of such paths? A naive strategy might be to try listing all possible paths, but as you can imagine, this quickly becomes unwieldy as the grid size increases, leading potentially to an overwhelming number of paths to account for. So, we need a smarter approach.

Enter dynamic programming. Instead of recalculating the paths for each possible position, we can store the number of paths leading to each position on the grid in a table. Let's start by thinking about the simplest cases: the bottom row and the rightmost column. For any position along the last row or last column, there's only one path to the end because the robot can only continue straight to the goal from there.

Building upon that, for every other position on the grid, we can use the results we've already computed: the path count for each cell is simply the sum of the paths from the cell directly below it and the cell directly to the right of it. This is because those are the only two moves the robot could have made to reach any given cell.

Through this method, we can fill in a table of path counts from the bottom right corner back to the top left corner. This bottom-up approach ensures that by the time we reach the starting position again, at the top-left corner, we've accounted for all possible paths to the bottom-right corner.

Now you might wonder about the efficiency. The beauty of this dynamic programming solution is its efficiency in both time and space. We loop through each cell once, resulting in a time complexity proportional to the product of m and n, which is quite manageable given the constraints. We also keep a table that stores results for every grid position, leading to a similar space complexity. These considerations provide a substantial improvement over our brute-force scenario, where memorizing previous results permits us to consider each path just once.

With this intuitive blend of grid-based recursion and dynamic memory, we've turned a potentially unwieldy combinatorial problem into one that can be solved cleanly and efficiently.
