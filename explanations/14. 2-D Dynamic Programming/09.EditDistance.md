# Explanation for 09.EditDistance

Imagine you have two words, and you need to transform the first word into the second one using a minimal number of operations. These operations can be inserting a character, deleting a character, or replacing one character with another. The challenge is to figure out the smallest number of these operations required.

To build an intuitive understanding, let's dive into an example. Take two strings like "horse" and "ros." You might wonder, how do we transform "horse" into "ros" efficiently? One possible sequence of operations would be to first replace the 'h' with an 'r,' giving us "rorse." Then, by removing the first 'r,' we arrive at "rose." Finally, we remove the 'e' at the end of "rose" to get "ros." Count these steps, and we see it takes three operations.

To approach this problem methodically, we can utilize dynamic programming, a powerful technique that helps us solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, overlapping subproblems. Imagine constructing a grid where one dimension represents the characters of the first word and the other dimension represents the characters of the second word. The idea is to fill out this grid, where each cell at position (i, j) reflects the minimum number of operations required to convert the first i characters of the first word to the first j characters of the second word.

The insight here lies in recognizing the recursive nature of the problem. If the current characters of both words match, no additional operation is needed for these characters, and the value would be carried over from the previous state in our grid. If they don't match, we must consider the cost of all possible operations: inserting, deleting, or replacing a character. Specifically, the cell's value would become one plus the minimum of the three neighboring cells, each reflecting one of these operations, indicating the transition to this cell's state.

Think about handling special cases, such as when one word is entirely traversed but not the other. In these situations, the answer is simply the number of remaining characters, since they would all need to be added or removed depending on which word remains.

This strategic filling of the grid eventually builds up to our final answer, which resides in the bottom-right cell, representing the minimum operations needed to completely transform one word into the other.

From a complexity perspective, filling this grid involves iterating through each character of both words, resulting in a time complexity proportional to the product of their lengths. The space complexity mirrors this, due to storing all intermediate results in our grid.

To sum up, tackling the Edit Distance problem requires a blend of insight into character operations and the structured approach of dynamic programming, efficiently leading us to the minimum number of steps needed to morph one string into another.
