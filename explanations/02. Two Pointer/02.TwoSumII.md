# Explanation for 02.TwoSumII

Imagine you have a list of numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, meaning each number is less than or equal to the next one. Your task is to find two distinct numbers within this list that add up exactly to a specified target value. The indices of these numbers in the list – let's say they are index1 and index2 – should be returned to you, but remember, these indices must be 1-indexed. This means the position of the first element in the list is 1, not 0 as it would typically be in programming. Also, it's important that index1 is less than index2, and there's guaranteed to be exactly one pair of numbers that satisfies this condition.

To build some intuition, let’s consider why this problem is interesting. The key twist is that the array is already sorted. This unique property allows us to use a more efficient algorithm than simply checking every possible pair. If the array wasn’t sorted, a brute-force approach would involve checking the sum of every possible pair of numbers, which is not ideal for larger arrays as it would take too much time.

Instead, we can exploit this sorted order by using two pointers. Think of placing one pointer at the very beginning of the array and another pointer at the end. Why? Because the number at the start is the smallest, and the number at the end is the largest. By summing these two numbers, we can determine if our sum is equal to the target value we're looking for.

Let’s walk through this reasoning step by step. Initially, you sum the elements that the two pointers are currently pointing to. If their sum happens to match the target, you’ve found your solution, and you can return the adjusted indices right away. If the sum is less than the target, this tells us we need a larger total. Since the array is sorted, we can achieve a larger sum by moving the left pointer to the right, towards larger numbers. Conversely, if the sum is greater than the target, it means we need a smaller sum, so we move the right pointer to the left to try smaller numbers.

This method is not only elegant but efficient. It ensures that each number in the list is only looked at once, leading to a linear time complexity, which is optimal given the input is already sorted. By employing this two-pointer technique, you solve the problem swiftly without needing any extra space to store data beyond a few variables, thus adhering to the problem's constraint of using constant extra space.

The key takeaway here is recognizing the power of leveraging the initial conditions – in this case, the sorted order – to transform a potentially naive solution into an optimal one. Understanding and utilizing these properties is a hallmark of clever algorithmic thinking. This approach highlights how thinking about the problem structurally and using efficient theoretical constructs, such as the two-pointer technique in a sorted list, allows for elegant solutions that are both time and space-efficient.
