# Explanation for 05.TrappingRainWater

Imagine you're looking at a cross-section view of the ground after a rainy day, where each spot on this ground has a certain height that can act as a barrier to hold water. This setup is represented by a list of integers, where each number tells you how high that part of the ground is. The challenge is to figure out how much water could collect on top of this series of heights after it has rained.

To think about how we can solve this, let's start with a straightforward example. Picture valleys and peaks made by these heights. Water will be trapped primarily in the valleys since these are bounded by higher points on either side. Imagine pouring water over this whole landscape. The water can only accumulate up to the height of the shortest boundary on either side of any given valley.

An initial thought might be to look at each position in this landscape and try to determine how much water can sit there. For each point, you'd need to find the tallest boundary to its left and right. Once you have these points, the water level above this position would be as high as the smallest of these two boundaries, minus the height at your current position. The difference, if positive, is the water volume at this point.

A naive approach would involve scanning left to find that boundary and then scanning right for the second boundary, leading to a solution with a time complexity that's impractical for large inputs. Instead, consider using precomputed arrays: one for the maximum heights to the left of every position and another for the maximum heights to the right. With these arrays in hand, you can quickly compute the trapped water height for each position in constant time, as both max heights are known upfront. This method effectively reduces the repetitive work, making the solution more efficient. However, this requires extra space to store these arrays.

Yet, what if we wanted to maintain that efficiency but with less space? Here, the "two-pointer" technique steps in. By using two pointers, one starting from the left end of the height array and another from the right, we can track the maximum heights incrementally as we converge toward the center. By comparing the current maximum heights seen on either side, we can determine which side's boundary limits the water level at each step. If the left boundary is the limiting factor, you focus on the left pointer and update its maximum height as you inch forward, and vice versa for the right. This approach allows us to keep our space usage minimal while still passing over the heights array only once, optimizing both time and space complexity.

In conclusion, the key to mastering this problem lies in understanding that the potential water volume is always determined by the shorter of the two potential boundaries at any point. By strategies such as precomputing boundaries or the two-pointer method, you can efficiently calculate how much water each part of this landscape can hold, turning a seemingly complex setup into a manageable problem.
