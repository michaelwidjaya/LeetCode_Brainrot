# Explanation for 02.MergeInterval

Imagine you have a collection of time intervals represented as pairs of start and end times. Your task is to take these intervals and combine any that overlap into a single larger interval. The key is to merge overlapping intervals so that you have a set of non-overlapping intervals covering the same range of times as the original set.

To start, let's consider what it means for intervals to overlap. If you have two intervals, say, A and B, they overlap if the start of one interval is less than or equal to the end of the other. For instance, if A starts at 1 and ends at 3, and B starts at 2 and ends at 6, these intervals overlap because 2 is within the range of A. In such cases, you would merge these intervals to form a new interval that starts at the earliest start point and ends at the latest end point, which in our case is from 1 to 6.

To solve this problem efficiently, let's build a strategy that ensures we look at each interval systematically. The first step would be to organize the intervals in some logical order. Since overlapping relates to starting points, weâ€™ll sort the list based on the start time of each interval. Sorting ensures that once we examine an interval, any subsequent intervals only need to be checked for overlap going forward, as they start later.

Once sorted, you proceed by considering each interval one by one. You begin with the first interval and treat it initially as its own, separate interval. Then, you move to the next interval, checking whether it overlaps with the current interval being considered. If an overlap exists, you merge them by adjusting the end of the current interval to the maximum of the two overlapping intervals' end times. If there's no overlap, you move on, treating the current interval as complete and starting to check the next interval separately.

The crucial insight here is the merging step: you only ever extend the end of an interval if there's an overlap. This ensures you capture all overlapping sections in one go without needing to split them apart again later. By maintaining a list of merged intervals as you progress, you can build up a final list of cleanly merged intervals with no overlaps.

In terms of efficiency, the most computationally intensive step here is sorting the intervals, which takes a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals. The subsequent pass through the list of intervals to check for overlaps happens in linear time, O(n). Overall, the entire solution relies mostly on the cost of sorting, making it efficient and practical even for relatively large numbers of intervals.

To recap, the key elements of this problem are recognizing overlapping intervals, sorting them to streamline the merging process, and systematically combining intervals using a systematic pass through the list. By following these steps, you ensure all overlaps are accounted for without redundant processing.
