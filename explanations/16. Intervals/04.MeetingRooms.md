# Explanation for 04.MeetingRooms

Imagine you have a packed schedule filled with back-to-back meetings. Each meeting is defined by a start and an end time. Our goal is to determine whether it's possible for one person to attend all these meetings without any overlap. The condition is quite straightforward: you should be able to smoothly transition from one meeting to the next without rushing down the hall or overlapping into the previous or subsequent meeting’s time.

Let's visualize this with an example. Consider three meetings: the first starts at time zero and ends at thirty, the second starts at five and ends at ten, and the third meeting starts at fifteen and ends at twenty. To decide if attending all these meetings is feasible, ask yourself: can each meeting follow another without any two overlapping?

A naive approach might be to compare every pair of meetings to check for overlaps. But there’s a more elegant and efficient way. Imagine lining all the meetings up chronologically by their starting time. This gives us a neat row where we can easily see if any meeting starts before the previous one has ended. This ordering helps us proceed through the meetings just once in linear fashion.

Now let's talk through the thought process for this ordered approach. The critical insight is that once the meetings are sorted by start time, our task is reduced to a simple comparison. Starting from the first meeting, ensure that its end time is less than or equal to the next meeting’s start time. If that holds true for every consecutive pair of meetings, they all fit into a perfect non-overlapping sequence.

If anyone of these comparisons reveals an overlap — meaning a meeting starts before the previous meeting is complete — then conflict exists, and it would be impossible for a person to attend both meetings. On the other hand, if all comparisons are clear, congratulations: attending all the appointments without conflict is viable.

Therefore, by using sorting and a single pass through the ordered list, we achieve an efficient and optimal solution to determine if the schedule is feasible. The insight of sorting helps reduce complexity from potentially quadratic to linearithmic, balancing our need for rapid correctness checks with computational efficiency. This strategy exemplifies the power of choosing the right data structure and process in algorithms.
