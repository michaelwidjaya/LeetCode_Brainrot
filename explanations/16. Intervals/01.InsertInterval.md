# Explanation for 01.InsertInterval

Imagine you're working with a sequence of intervals, each represented by a pair of numbers indicating their start and end points. These intervals are organized so there are no overlaps between them, and they're sorted according to their starting point. Now, you're given a new interval, and your task is to insert this new interval into the sequence while maintaining the non-overlapping property and ensuring the list remains sorted.

To tackle this problem, let's break down the task conceptually. The core idea is to weave in this new interval into the pre-existing order of intervals, merging any overlapping ones to maintain the correct structure.

First, consider the sequence of intervals you're starting with. Since they are already non-overlapping and sorted, you know that each interval appears in a way where the end of one interval precedes the start of the next. This sorted structure is key to how we approach the solution efficiently.

Now, begin by traversing through your list of intervals. Initially, you'll find all the intervals that come entirely before this new interval, meaning their end is less than the start of the new interval. These intervals can simply be added to your result as they are, because the new interval clearly doesn't affect them.

Next, you handle the core part: intersecting intervals. Here, you look for scenarios where your new interval overlaps with the current interval you're examining. Overlapping occurs when the start of the current interval is less than or equal to the end of the new interval. For any such overlap, you want to merge intervals. This merging means finding the smallest start point from the overlapping intervals and the largest end point. You adjust your new interval boundaries accordingly, effectively absorbing intersecting intervals into this new interval.

Finally, once you've handled potential overlaps, you're left with intervals in your original list that start after the end of your adjusted new interval. These can simply be added to your results, as they come after and don’t affect the ongoing merged interval.

The beauty of this approach lies in its simplicity and linearity. By making a single pass through the list of intervals, you can ensure that you efficiently integrate the new interval without unnecessary complexity. This linear pass respects both time and space complexity, efficiently using resources.

In summary, this problem is a classic example of using both sorted order and the properties of intervals—specifically their boundary overlaps—to merge efficiently. With each step, you thoughtfully adjust where your new interval fits within the existing ones, carefully maintaining the order and distinctness of the list as you go.
