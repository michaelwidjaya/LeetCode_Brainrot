# Explanation for 10.MergeKSortedLists

Imagine you're given several linked lists, each already sorted in increasing order. Your task is to merge all of these lists into one single, sorted linked list. The challenge is to do this as efficiently as possible.

When you first think about merging multiple sorted lists, a simple yet inefficient approach might come to mind: just combine all the lists into one big list and then sort it. However, sorting is computationally expensive, especially given the constraints where the total number of nodes across all lists can be very large. So while this brute-force method is straightforward, it certainly isn't optimal in terms of time complexity.

Let's explore a better way to merge these sorted lists, leveraging the fact that each individual list is already sorted. One intuitive approach is to merge two lists at a time. Much like merging two sorted arrays, you can repeatedly take the smallest front element from each list and append it to a new result list. By doing this, you'll always keep the final result in sorted order.

However, with multiple lists, you don't just want to simply merge them sequentially because this can lead to inefficiencies. Instead, think about using strategies from algorithms like merge sort, which is a classic divide-and-conquer technique. The idea here is to split the problem into smaller parts, merging pairs of lists together in steps, and thereby reducing the number of total operations required. This means, instead of linearly merging one list with the next, you divide the list of lists into halves, recursively merge each half, and then merge the results. This takes advantage of the efficiency of merging two lists and logarithmic depth of the recursive merge splits, leading to a nearly optimal merging process.

In terms of runtime complexity, we achieve O(N log k), where N is the total number of elements across all lists and k is the number of lists. This is because each element is part of exactly one comparison during each level of merging. Space complexity can vary depending on the method â€” iterative solutions can use constant space, while a recursive approach may have extra space proportional to the depth of the call stack.

The transformation from a naive to an optimal solution involves recognizing how merging two sorted lists efficiently can scale when generalized to k lists. By applying a method that strategically breaks the problem down into manageable parts, you are not only using the properties of sorted lists to your advantage but also minimizing unnecessary computational work, making the merging operation both elegant and efficient. It's like orchestrating a perfectly tuned symphony where every list knows when and how to blend with others for the most harmonious result.
