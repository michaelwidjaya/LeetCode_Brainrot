# Explanation for 01.ReverseLinkedList

Imagine you have a chain of dominoes, each one connected to the next, lying flat on a table in a sequence. Your task is to rearrange the dominoes such that their order is completely reversed. This, essentially, is the challenge of reversing a singly linked list in computer science.

In a singly linked list, each node, much like a domino, contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. Our goal is to make the first node point to nothing, thereby becoming the last node, and make every subsequent node point to the one that preceded it, ultimately turning the last node into the head of the list.

Let’s start by thinking about this process intuitively. If we follow the chain of dominoes or nodes from start to finish, we typically do so in a forward direction, from head to tail. But to reverse the list, you need to flip the direction of each pointer so that they lead backward instead. Picture yourself needing a temporary storage place to keep track of where you came from, since you’ll need to refer back to it as you reverse the sequence.

By using an iterative approach, you start from the head and move through each node, incrementally reversing the direction of the pointers. Initially, you'll manage this with a few placeholder variables: one for the node you're currently visiting, one for the node that should follow it in the new order, and one to temporarily hold onto the next node in line. As you traverse the list, you continuously adjust the links one by one — setting each node’s pointer to aim backward instead of forward.

Now, if we think about a recursive strategy, we take on a method that leans on the function call stack, a powerful aspect of recursion. Conceptually, you would push through all elements, diving deep into the list to reach the tail, turning it into a makeshift new head. As each recursive call completes, you backtrack, reversing the pointers in each frame from the deepest level back up to the initial level of the call. This method cleverly exploits the default behavior of the system stack to help manage the references essential for rearranging the links.

Both methodologies, iterative and recursive, achieve the same result of reversing the list, but they do so with different mindsets. The iterative method is often favored for its straightforward space efficiency, as it doesn't grow with the size of the list. The recursive technique, on the other hand, offers an elegant, compact solution that conceptually mirrors the process of working backward through a deeply nested structure. Understanding both approaches not only deepens your grasp of linked list manipulation but also enriches your ability to think flexibly about problem-solving in computer science.
