# Explanation for 05.PlusOne

Imagine you have a number represented not as a typical integer, but as an array of its digits. Each element in the array corresponds to a single digit of the number, ordered from the most significant to the least significant. Our task is to increment this number by one and return the new array representation of this updated number.

Consider, for example, the number 123, which would be represented as the array [1, 2, 3]. If we want to add one to this number, the intuitive approach is simply to increase the last digit, which results in 124, or [1, 2, 4] as an array. This is a straightforward case because none of the digits were 9, meaning there was no need for cascading adjustments.

Now, consider a slightly trickier scenario with the number 129. This is represented as [1, 2, 9]. When we add one here, the last digit turns into 10, which means it should become 0, and we need to carry over the one to the next highest digit. This changes the nine to a zero in our array, transforming [1, 2, 9] into [1, 3, 0].

The most nuanced case arises when all the digits turn into nines, such as with the number 999, which is represented as [9, 9, 9]. Adding one leads to a complete overflow where each nine becomes zero, and we introduce a new leading one at the beginning of the array. Therefore, this results in [1, 0, 0, 0].

To methodically solve this problem, think of processing these digits from the least significant to the most significant. We begin at the last digit and check if it is less than nine. If it is, we simply increment it, and we are done. However, if it's a nine, it means we set that position to zero and carry over a one to the next digit. We continue performing this operation for each digit, moving leftward. If we propagate a carry out of the leftmost digit, it means the whole number needs to expand in magnitude, requiring an extra digit at the start, which we initialize to one.

This incremental, digit-by-digit update is efficient and easy to understand once you recognize the roles played by carrying over and how this depends on encountering nines. Ultimately, with this insight, you can handle any array of digits, conveniently adding one to produce the correct new array format of the incremented number. This strategy ensures that our solution is both intuitive and performs optimally in linear time, directly proportional to the length of the digits array.
