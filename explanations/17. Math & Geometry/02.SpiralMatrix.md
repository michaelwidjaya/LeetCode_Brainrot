# Explanation for 02.SpiralMatrix

Imagine you're given a two-dimensional grid, a matrix, and your task is to extract all its elements but in a very particular way: following a spiral pattern. Let's visualize this by imagining a rectangular sheet of stamps where you want to start at the top-left corner, move to the right, and then when you can't go right any further, you spiral downwards, then move left, then upwards, and repeat that pattern, getting all the stamps without ever passing a position more than once. This process continues until you've gathered every single element in this spiraling journey.

To understand this intuitively, think of a box. You begin drawing a line across the top, then wrap down the right side, across the bottom, up the left side, and if thereâ€™s still space inside, you continue the pattern inwards. The challenge is to programmatically trace this spiral path through the grid without stepping outside its boundaries or revisiting any spot.

Now, let's approach this problem logically. Initially, consider a straightforward idea; go layer by layer. You process the outermost layer first, moving in that clockwise direction. Once the outermost boundary is complete, you move inward to the next concentric rectangle, effectively shifting your boundaries inward both horizontally and vertically. You maintain four boundaries: top, bottom, left, and right. These boundaries dictate your movements as you spiral inwards.

Start at the top boundary going right, then descend the right boundary downward. If there is space beyond the corners, turn left across the bottom boundary. Finally, move upwards along the left boundary until you meet where you began. After completing a full loop, you adjust your boundaries to move inwards: increase the top boundary, decrease the right boundary, decrease the bottom boundary, and increase the left boundary. You repeat this until the boundaries converge.

The key idea is managing these boundaries to ensure you only process parts of the matrix you haven't seen before. You incrementally peel off the matrix layer by layer. The end of your journey is signaled when your adjusted boundaries no longer allow another complete pass, meaning you've already visited every possible position.

This solution is efficient because at each step, you're simply traversing the boundaries of these submatrices, ensuring it's proportional to the number of elements in the matrix. You're essentially drawing imaginary rectangles that shrink over time, adjusting only when necessary to capture the entire matrix precisely in spiral order. This technique offers an elegant and systematic means of extracting data from a matrix that models a real-world pathfinding scenario in a confined space.
