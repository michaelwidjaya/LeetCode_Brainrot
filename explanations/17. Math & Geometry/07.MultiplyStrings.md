# Explanation for 07.MultiplyStrings

Imagine you are tasked with multiplying two numbers, but instead of working with integers directly, these numbers are given as strings. For instance, you might have "123" and "456". Your objective is to return the result of their multiplication, also as a string, which, in this case, would be "56088".

At first glance, you might be tempted to convert these strings into integers, perform the multiplication, and then turn the result back into a string. However, the challenge is not to use any built-in operations that handle these conversions directly because of the constraints imposed, possibly to test your understanding of number manipulation at a more fundamental level.

Let's start with a simple analogy: multiplying using paper and pencil method. Remember how you multiply manually by writing one number beneath the other, then multiplying and carrying over? That's the exact process we need to replicate. Each digit of the second number is multiplied by each digit of the first number, and like in school, results are shifted according to their place values before they are added together.

To break it down further for clarity, consider multiplying "23" by "47". Start by reversing both strings because this lets us deal with smaller units first, working from right to left, which is more intuitive for our carrying operations. 

First, multiply the digit '7' in "47" by each digit in "23". Multiply '7' by '3' getting 21, plug down the 1, and carry over 2. Now multiply '7' by '2', giving 14, add the carried 2, totaling 16, where you plug down 6 and carry over 1. 

Next, move on to the digit '4' (in "47") but remember, this needs to be shifted left by one position because it's one place of magnitude higher (i.e., tens instead of units). So, multiply '4' by '3', getting 12. You must add this to the next position over. Then multiply '4' by '2', add any carry, and shift appropriately.

Now, you simply sum all these results that have been appropriately shifted and combined. The underlying idea here is that multiplication is, at its core, repeated addition and positional notation.

Finally, you need to handle the not-so-glamorous part of this approach: managing zeros and any potential carries across these calculations. As humans, the brain is good at knowing when a trailing zero should simply be ignored, and when to stop an addition loop. But when you instruct a computer, you'll implement logic to strip unnecessary leading zeros in your final string.

This problem is a wonderful exercise in simulating low-level arithmetic operations. By stripping away high-level language conveniences and dealing with number positions and carries, you gain a deeper appreciation for how multiplication algorithms are implemented. Through this detailed breakdown, the solution strategy transforms from a naive direct conversion attempt to a sophisticated simulation of basic arithmetic, teaching us to think like the computer's arithmetic logic unit.
