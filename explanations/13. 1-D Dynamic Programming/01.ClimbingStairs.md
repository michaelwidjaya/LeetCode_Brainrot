# Explanation for 01.ClimbingStairs

Imagine you're standing at the foot of a staircase. You have the freedom to take one step or two steps at a time. Your goal is to figure out in how many distinct ways you can reach the top if the staircase has 'n' steps. Let's break down the problem conceptually, like a puzzle we need to solve with logic and some mathematical intuition.

At first glance, if you're thinking of the simplest scenarios, you'll notice that with one step, there’s clearly only one way to get to the top, and that’s by taking that single step. With two steps, you have two options: either you take two single steps, or you take one big step directly — jump, if you will — over those two steps. 

Now, things get a little more interesting when we consider three steps. You can choose a combination path: three single steps, a combination of one single step followed by a two-step jump, or a two-step jump followed by a final single step. These scenarios demonstrate the combinatorial nature of the problem.

The key insight here is realizing this is akin to a Fibonacci problem. If we think about it, to reach the nth step, we can only arrive there either from the (n-1)th step by taking a single step, or from the (n-2)th step by taking a dual step. Therefore, the number of ways to get to step n is essentially the sum of the ways to get to the previous step and the step before that.

This reveals a pattern quite similar to that of the Fibonacci sequence. In the Fibonacci sequence, each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. Our problem, similar in structure, can be solved using this recurrence relation: you find the total ways by adding the number of ways to reach the previous step and the step before that. 

We can articulate this solution efficiently by using a simple iterative approach. Instead of recalculating from scratch or using excessive memory, we can store only the last two computed values, continuously updating them as we iteratively calculate the number of ways to reach each successive step from step 1 up to n. This results in a linear time complexity, which is optimal for this problem. It also keeps the space complexity constant because you're only reusing a couple of variables.

What we have done here is essentially frame a physical movement problem into a mathematical challenge, and from a computing perspective, leverage the simplicity of iteration and minimal space to produce an elegant and optimized solution. This shows how sometimes the most complex-seeming puzzles can be elegantly untangled by recognizing underlying patterns and applying the right abstractions.
