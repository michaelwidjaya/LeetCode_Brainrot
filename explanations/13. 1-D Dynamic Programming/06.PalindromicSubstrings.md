# Explanation for 06.PalindromicSubstrings

Imagine you're working with a string, and your task is to count the number of substrings within this string that are palindromes. As a quick refresher, a string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards. For instance, "aba" and "aa" are palindromes, while "abc" is not.

Let's start by considering the simpler approach first. The idea is to examine each possible center of a potential palindrome within the string. You can think of this center as being either a single character, leading to palindromes of odd length, or a pair of characters, resulting in palindromes of even length. The strategy involves expanding outwards symmetrically from this center as long as you observe matching characters on both sides. Each time a valid palindrome is identified, you increment your palindrome count.

For example, using the string "aaa", you would initially look at each "a" individually, all of which are palindromes by themselves, yielding a count of three. Then, you would examine the paired centers and discover "aa" palindromes twice. Finally, expanding from the middle "a" to include all characters yields the single palindrome "aaa". Altogether, this sums to six palindromic substrings.

This approach, akin to expanding around each center, involves systematically checking all such centers — first considering odd-length palindromes, and then even-length ones. Here, the time complexity is quadratic. This is due to checking each character as a potential center and expanding as far as possible for matches.

However, there's a more refined approach if you're interested in achieving better performance. This brings us to an optimized technique, often referenced as Manacher's Algorithm. This method is incredibly efficient, reducing the time complexity to linear. Conceptually, it employs a clever pre-processing step by inserting special separator characters between each pair of characters in the string. This ensures all potential palindromes can be treated uniformly, effectively dealing with odd and even lengths simultaneously. Each position in this transformed string serves as a center for palindrome expansion.

Through a combination of symmetry and previously computed results, Manacher's Algorithm dynamically computes the length of the largest palindrome centered at each character. Importantly, it leverages past information to minimize redundant expansions, thus accelerating the process substantially.

Think of it like leveraging a mirror's reflection to better estimate the symmetry of an image without needing to scrutinize every detail afresh. The magic lies in using already discovered palindromic properties to predict and validate new ones, drastically reducing computation time.

In both cases, the core insight is recognizing palindromes are defined by symmetry, and that understanding your starting point — whether a centralized character or set — allows systematic exploration of what's possible within a string. The differing efficiencies come from how the algorithms leverage past discoveries to streamline future exploration. This blend of direct exploration with strategic reuse of information exemplifies the power of algorithmic thinking in solving problems more efficiently.
