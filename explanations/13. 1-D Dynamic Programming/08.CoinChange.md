# Explanation for 08.CoinChange

Imagine you are a cashier with a drawer full of coins of various denominations, and you want to make a specific amount of change using the fewest number of coins possible. But the store owner has given you a challenge: you can't just rely on muscle memoryâ€”each decision should be calculated to find the most efficient pattern of coins. If it's not possible to create that exact amount with your coins, you should realize it pretty quickly.

Think about this problem: you're given an array of different coin denominations and an amount you want to achieve using those coins. Your goal is to return the minimum number of coins needed or determine if it's impossible to do so.

Let's use the intuitive example of trying to make eleven units of currency using coins of denominations one, two, and five. You could achieve this by using two five-unit coins and one one-unit coin. But where does this optimal solution come from? What's the thought process?

Initially, you might think of a brute force approach: listing every combination of coins and picking the one with the fewest total coins. However, this would be computationally exhaustive and inefficient, especially as the amount and number of denominations increase.

Instead, you can use a systematic approach leveraging dynamic programming. Imagine having a table where each entry represents the minimum number of coins needed to achieve every amount from zero to the target amount. Start with the simple base case: if you need zero amount, you don't need any coins, so that entry is zero.

For every subsequent amount, consider each coin denomination. If the denomination is less than or equal to the amount you're trying to achieve, see how many coins it would take to make the remaining amount when this coin is used. The entry for the current amount becomes the smallest of these possibilities, plus the one coin you've just used.

Let's visualize this: consider making amount eleven using coins of one, two, and five. Start from zero, expanding upward. At each step, decide the minimum number of coins required by examining previous possibilities. When you reach eleven, you try to find which entry gives you the minimum number when you calculate using current coin options, ensuring efficiency.

This dynamic programming approach essentially builds the solution incrementally, checking combinations intelligently without testing them all explicitly. It uses the optimal solutions of subproblems, which gracefully leads to an optimal solution for the original problem.

If, at the end of the process, the entry for your target amount still suggests that the amount cannot be achieved, meaning the table entry remains very high because no combination worked, you return that it's impossible.

By transforming a potentially overwhelming problem into smaller, manageable parts, you solve the overarching problem efficiently. This method not only provides the answer but also deepens your understanding of the problem mechanics, leading to an elegant and optimal solution.
