# Explanation for 12.PartitionEqualSubsetSum

Imagine you have a collection of positive integers, and your task is to determine if you can split this collection into two groups with equal sums. This is akin to preparing two perfectly balanced teams from a pool of players such that each team’s total skill level is the same, assuming the players' skill levels are given by their respective numbers.

To solve this problem, the first step is understanding the sum of all these integers. If the sum is odd, it’s immediately clear that we cannot split it into two equal halves, because no two integers can sum to be a fraction. This is an important insight — if the total sum is odd, instantly conclude that it’s impossible to partition the array as required.

However, if the sum is even, you're tasked with finding a subset of numbers that precisely sum up to half of the total. This now becomes a more specific problem: can you find a subset whose sum equals a particular number? This is a classic subset-sum problem, which is a well-known challenge.

Initially, you might think to explore every possible combination of numbers to see if any subset adds up to this target sum. But this brute-force method, where you test every potential subset, grows exponentially with the size of the list; hence it’s computationally infeasible when dealing with larger inputs.

Instead, you can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently. Dynamic programming involves breaking the problem down into smaller, manageable pieces and solving each of these smaller problems just once. In this context, you’ll want to keep track of subproblems asking whether it’s possible to achieve certain sums using the available numbers.

The approach involves constructing a two-dimensional table where the rows represent the numbers to consider, and the columns represent all possible sums up to the target sum. For each number, you decide whether to include it in your current subset or not, essentially dividing your problem into two branches at each step: one where you include the current number in your subset and reduce the problem to finding the remaining sum with the other numbers, and one where you don't include the number and continue trying to find the sum with the other numbers.

By carefully applying this strategy, which examines previous solutions to smaller subproblems, you build up the solution to the overall problem of whether or not a subset exists with the desired sum. This table allows you to deduce whether it's possible to reach the target sum step by step and ultimately to decide whether the array can be partitioned as requested.

The beauty of this dynamic programming solution is in its efficiency. Instead of exploring all subsets, you're systematically constructing solutions in a way that efficiently leverages previous results. The time complexity, typically constrained by the number of items and the target sum, is reduced significantly from the brute-force alternative. This is a quintessential example of transforming an exponential search problem into a more tractable polynomial-time solution using insightful symmetry in problem structure and memory of past results.
