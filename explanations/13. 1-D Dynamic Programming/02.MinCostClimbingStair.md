# Explanation for 02.MinCostClimbingStair

Imagine you're at the bottom of a staircase and each step has a specific cost associated with stepping on it. What you need to do is figure out the minimum cost required to reach the top of the staircase. You can choose to start off at either the first or the second step and, once on the steps, you can decide whether to climb one step or jump two steps at a time. What you're looking for is the most cost-effective path to reach the top.

To visualize the challenge more clearly, consider a few steps. If the costs of stepping on each of these steps are given, your task becomes identifying the least expensive series of moves that take you to the top. It's a classic optimization problem where you're balancing between paying a bit more now to potentially save more later, versus consistently paying less upfront.

One naive way to think about it might simply involve considering every possible path to climb the stairs. However, due to the exponential number of paths for each step, this brute-force method becomes computationally expensive very quickly as the number of steps increases.

The key to efficiently solving this problem lies in understanding the problem as one of making an optimal decision at each step, using previously computed results to make future decisions more efficientâ€”a hallmark characteristic of dynamic programming.

We start by recognizing that the minimum cost to reach a particular step depends on the minimum cost to reach the previous one or two steps and then adding the cost of stepping onto the current step. You can think of it as building a solution bottom-up: as you calculate the cost for later steps, you use it to figure out what's optimal for the initial steps.

To facilitate this, we iterate backwards from the top of the staircase to determine these costs. Starting from the penultimate steps, for each step, we choose the cheaper option between taking one or two steps forward. This means you're building up a solution from the sub-optimal problems you've already solved, paving a way to solve the original problem. In the end, you simply compare the costs of starting from the first or the second step since those are the two starting points available to you.

Ultimately, this approach ensures we only go over the list of costs a single time, leading to a linear time complexity. The beauty of this method is that it captures the essence of dynamic programming: storing partial solutions to use them in building up the final answer in an efficient manner. By carefully leveraging these accumulated results, we transform what initially seems like a daunting task of combinatorial possibilities into a simple walk up the stairs.
