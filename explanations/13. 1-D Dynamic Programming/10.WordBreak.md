# Explanation for 10.WordBreak

Imagine you have a long string of lowercase letters, like a well-crafted sentence without any spaces. Your task is to figure out whether you can break this string into separate words from a given dictionary, placing a separator between these words so that the original string is reconstructed accurately from the dictionary. Think of it like trying to reconstruct a meaningful sentence from alphabet soup using a specific set of gold-star approved words.

Let's consider how we might tackle this challenge. Start by envisioning the string as a sequence of choices or branches, where at each stage, you explore whether a substring from the current position matches any of the words in the dictionary. If you find a match, you leap forward by the length of the matched word and continue exploring from the new position. This way, you are effectively trying to tile the entire string with pieces from your dictionary, checking each time if you have covered the string entirely by the end.

As you can imagine, initially testing all possibilities might seem daunting and inefficient. Each position in the string could represent a split point, leading to a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. However, the key to an efficient approach involves recognizing overlapping subproblems and using dynamic programming to keep track of what segments of the string can be constructed.

The idea of dynamic programming here is to methodically build a solution array, where each entry represents whether you can successfully form the string up to that point using the dictionary. You start from the very end of the string, noting that if you've come this far, you have effectively segmented the string. Then, you backward-check each dictionary word to see if it fits at the current position, building the solution for smaller segments step-by-step back to the start.

With this approach, each position in the string checks each dictionary word; you ensure that you only move forward in your string if you find a match, preventing unnecessary exploration. This eliminates guessing and instead uses informed, logical progression through the string — akin to solving a puzzle by confirming each piece fits before moving to the next.

In essence, by using dynamic programming and working backward, you efficiently map out a series of true or false conclusions that tell you if the entire string can be constructed from your dictionary. It's like completing a mosaic by carefully placing one tile at a time, ensuring that each contributes to completing the picture. The solution essentially tells you if it’s possible to fill the canvas with the pieces you have, or if it’s an unbridgable gap keeping you from that perfect reconstruction.
