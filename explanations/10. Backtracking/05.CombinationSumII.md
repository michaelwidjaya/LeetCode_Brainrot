# Explanation for 05.CombinationSumII

Imagine you are given a collection of numbers, which we're calling the candidates, and a specific target sum you want to achieve by summing a combination of some of these numbers. However, there's a catch: each number in this list of candidates can only be used once, and you must ensure that the combinations you come up with are unique. Let's make this clear with an example: suppose you have a list of numbers that includes [10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1, 5] and you're looking to form combinations that sum up to the number 8. You'll need to generate all possible sets of numbers from this list where the sum equals 8, but again, each number can appear only once in any combination, and no two combinations should look exactly the same.

This problem encourages us to think creatively about how to explore combinations. The primary challenge here arises from the need to both ensure that each number is used only once per combination and to avoid repeating the same combination in a different order. One smart way to manage this complexity is to first sort the candidate numbers. Sorting helps to systematically handle and skip duplicates, ensuring that the same number in consecutive positions doesn’t generate the same combination again unnecessarily.

Once sorted, envision a backtracking approach wherein you explore whether to include each candidate number in your running sum. Consider backtracking as laying a path where you add numbers step-by-step, exploring deeper possibilities with each inclusion, and retracting or backtracking when you overshoot the target. When a candidate number is included, you subtract it from the target, adjusting the remainder of the sum to be achieved. If at any point your path delivers an exact sum equal to the target, you've found a valid combination.

Essentially, this is a depth-first search over possible combinations; you branch out by including or excluding each number at every decision point. What might seem straightforward is complicated by the need to avoid duplicate combinations. Yet, our earlier step of sorting the array proves invaluable here. If, as you explore, you find that a number is the same as the one that immediately precedes it—say you've used a 2, and you again encounter a 2—skipping this subsequent identical number avoids redundantly revisiting the same combination setup.

You might wonder about the complexity. The nature of exploring subsets means there's an exponential number of potential combinations you might theoretically check. However, the conscious avoidance of duplicates clusters that exploration specifically around new and valid variations, making the approach more efficient than a brute force enumeration.

In summary, mastering this problem involves structuring your process akin to a decision tree, deeply understanding the value of sorting for order and duplicate management, and judiciously backtracking to explore only new, potential paths that achieve the target sum. This method not only respects the constraints but leverages them to systematically discover all valid, unique combinations.
